# PlaceMark-POI-Svelte

## Project Description
The website shows a map of dormitories, supermarkets, postal offices and hospitals in Regensburg, for incoming students to Regensburg. They can create an account to log in, view or create places in the city. They can see the name, address, description and an image of each place. Students can easily see postal offices and supermarkets near to their dormitory. They can also see which dorm is close to many facilities when choosing a dormitory. The website also features an image gallery and simple analytics. 

Admin has an additional view where they can see the list of users and are able to delete them.

The app uses database and API call from this [backend](https://github.com/anhnhivu/PlaceMark-POI-Hapi) repository.

## Testing

You can create an account and log in to see the map, or use the sample user account. 
```
email: sam@smith.com
password: fireonfire
```
Unfortunately, admin accounts are limited and can only be created in the backend.
